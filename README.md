Create a `.token` in the same folder as the bot, and set its contents to your Discord bot token (with no new line at the end of the file).

From a command prompt, create a virtual environment for Python, install the requirements, then run `bot.py`, e.g.

```
python -m venv .env
.env\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
python bot.py
```
