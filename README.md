# WORK IN PROGRESS

1. Create a `.token` in the same folder as the bot, and set its contents to your Discord bot token (with no new line
   at the end of the file).
1. Run the `build.bat` script. This will prepare the bot in a new `.bot` directory.
1. In that directory, run `run.bat` to start the bot.
